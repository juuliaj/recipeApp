## About recipeApp

In recipeApp you can create your own user and search through a variety of different recipes. Recipes are fetched from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com).
There is a Firebase realtime database as a shoppinglist, so you can add missing ingredients to it. Authentication is made with Firebase and all of the users have their own database.
